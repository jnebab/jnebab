I'm a front-end developer based from Cabanatuan City. I am currently working at CoDev Philippines. At times, I accept short projects thru online freelancing.

This year, outside from my usual work routine. I will mostly spend my time learning
* ðŸ”­ Blockchain, specifically learning how smart contracts works and how to develop it with Solidity.
* ðŸŒ± I might also explore on Web Assembly with Rust.
* ðŸ‘¯ Playing some NFT games might also be a thing for me to continue this year, and;
* ðŸ¤” I want to learn more about front-end architecture and system designs

Current progress...
* ðŸ”­ Still on web3 stuff, currently doing front-end integration for rosepad.io. 
* ðŸŒ± Also doing buildspace.so tutorials at times.
* ðŸ“¦ Finally became an OSS contributor with Web3 PH directory project.
* ðŸ‘¯ Found this community by a dev-turned-youtuber. Tech discussions mostly on react/next arch and system designs. Great stuffs for real!
