I'm a front-end developer based from Cabanatuan City. I am currently working at CoDev Philippines. At times, I accept short projects thru online freelancing. You can check me in [![Upwork](https://img.shields.io/badge/UpWork-6FDA44?style=for-the-badge&logo=Upwork&logoColor=white)](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~018ce28e8b31163cf4).

This year, outside from my usual work routine. I will mostly spend my time learning
* ðŸ”­ Blockchain, specifically learning how smart contracts works and how to develop it with Solidity.
* ðŸŒ± I might also explore on Web Assembly with Rust.
* ðŸ‘¯ Playing some NFT games might also be a thing for me to continue this year, and;
* ðŸ¤” I want to learn more about front-end architecture and system designs

Current progress...
* ðŸ”­ Still on web3 stuffs, on a side-project at the moment, doing work mostly on smart contract integration. 
* Also doing buildspace.so tutorials at times.
* Found this community by a dev-turned-youtuber. Tech discussions mostly on react/next arch and system designs. Great stuffs for real!
* Planning to make my own web portfolio soon.
